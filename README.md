Overview
--------

My task for the project was to make a sentiment analyser for english. It
takes the input and classifies it as positive, negative or neutral. Also,
it gives hopefully an appropriate response to it. This module can been called
as a rather simple dialoque system. But as it was an unforunate setback, our
group work fell into pieces and this module was meant to complement our big
project, but now it stands alone.Unfortunately this module doesn't implement
any movement etc. I have to stress that the sentiment analyser isn't perfect:
it is faulty when it comes to regular sentences (eg greetings), but it is
good with sentences that have some kind of an emotion in it (eg opinion).
Hopefully you'll have as much fun with it as I did.

How to
------

This module uses `Python` and `NLTK` (natural language toolkit). 
Therefore to use this dialogue module, first of all you need to install
[nltk](http://www.nltk.org/install.html).
After that you can start testing the module by executing
```
python nao.py
```
