conflict	The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.
conflict	The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.
negative	The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.
